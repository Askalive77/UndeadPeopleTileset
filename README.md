## Folder structure changes!

Tileset now ships with mod tilesets in apropriate folders. No need to install tileset mods anymore! 
Please check instalation instructions.

## Prerequisites

This tileset always updating to content from latest experimental versions of the game.

Latest game version can be downloaded here https://cataclysmdda.org/experimental/

Bright Nights fork can be found here https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN#cataclysm-bright-nights

## Direct download link

## Installing

Download archive, put folders data and gfx from TILESET folder in Cataclysm Installation folder (where cataclysm-tiles.exe is), in the game choose *UNDEAD_PEOPLE (NEW VERSION)* or *UNDEAD_PEOPLE_LEGACY* tileset in **Settings->Options->Graphics->Choose Tileset**


*UNDEAD_PEOPLE (NEW VERSION)* - latest updated version of the tileset. Now when you install tileset you also install tilesets for mods in appropriate folders, so you don't need to use mods with tilesets for other mods. Please create issue if you experience troubles, i am still figuring out how to do it right and how to describe it propertly in README.
If you still want them you will need to copy Mods forlder from TILESET_MODS folder in to cataclysm instalation folder and then enable mods with the same name as mod what are you going to use plus "- UndeadPeople Tileset" in it's name under "graphical" category.

So for mod like *"PKs Rebalancing"* you will need to enable *"PKs Rebalancing - UndeadPeople Tileset"* along side with it to get graphics for this mod.

*UNDEAD_PEOPLE_LEGACY* - old version of the tileset. 

Old Xotto tileset is now included in archive under different name and fixed for the last version, cause i really dislike what cata devs did and stole name of this tileset for their new one what looks totaly different. I want people to see actual tileset i started working with.

## How to install my graphical Mods
Put *Mods* folder in "Cataclysm Installation folder", **NOT**  in "Cataclysm Installation folder"/data, that way you can separate mods what are updated with the game and mods you downloaded somewhere else, what you need to update by hand.

Mods what bundled with this tileset (other then mods with graphics for other mods) are graphical mods designed to work with this tileset and change certain aspects of it.

If graphical mod (or any other mod with supplemental tileset inside (Secronom, Arcana, etc.)) do not work - save the game, close it, open it again and load save. It should 100% hook mods with tileset to the game.

## My own Memory Color Settings
Make memory black and white while making it darker so darkness can be distinguished from memory. In my opinion make the game way better looking. Try it out!

## Modpack With FULL UNDEAD support (No Mods with tileset mentioned below needed)
This tileset is now works with Kenan's Mod Pack 

This modpack consist of all interesting mods for Cataclysm, they always updated to the latest game version and have mod tiles from Undead People already installed in to them. So you do not need to use Mods with tilesets from my package to see graphics for these mods in the game. Please check this modpack for all interesting and updated mods!


https://github.com/Kenan2000/CDDA-Kenan-Modpack - for CDDA 


https://github.com/Kenan2000/Bright-Nights-Kenan-Mod-Pack - for BN


Despite my recomendations this modpack needs to be installed in *Cataclysm Installation folder*/data/mods (cause of the way cataclysm works), put all folders from "Kenan-Modpack" folder in there with agreeing on file replacement. Sadly that means what each time you update the game via Launcher (cause you lazy like that, and do not want to learn how you can update the game easily without it) it will likely erase all of the modpack files from *data* folder. So you need to reinstall it after each time you update the game. Sucks, i know. But it is how it is.

This tileset was provided with generous resourses from upcoming game Nearly Dead made by Xotto and Toro. In the future it will use many item graphics from this game in this tileset which was provided to me by Xotto with no gain to him or his game except for the mention of artists. Despite that i am gonna support and promote this game on this github for everybody to see. Please consider supporting it in the future, it looks like awesome Cataclysm inspired real time survival game and it is made by Cataclysm modders.

Tileset for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead (and for Bright Nights fork of this game) based on the works by Xotto, Waldo and others. My goal is to make most complete tileset for the game, with support for all mods what are out there.
